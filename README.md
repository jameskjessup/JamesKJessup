## Personal Website

Hi all, I plan on creating a personal website to display a few things going on in my life.

- First, I plan on adding my research and academic experiences.

- I also plan on including some courses and general subject areas I have experience in teaching/tutoring.

- Next, I plan on also including some projects that deep dive into the world of sport projections and analytics.

- Lastly, I also intend on including some miscellaneous projects that spark my own attention.

I'm not sure what the timeline will look like for implementing my personal website. However, I will try to update this file when I have a better idea.
